## Work Distribution
Our development as a team is divided into two sub-teams: front-end (Kevin and Noel) and back-end (Dylan and Dylan). Back-end has the job of constructing all of the complex underlying logic of how the program works. Front-end is tasked with making the UI and integrating the backend to work with it. The front-end lead is Noel and the back-end lead is Dylan Smith. They work to manage progress and communication within their sub-teams.

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
### Back-end
Back-end's main goal was to build the majority of the main architecture of the program. This means creating all of the classes and making all of their currently forseeable functions. After that, they were to move on to constructing the interactions between the classes and the methods of intended interaction with them. The majority of their work was planning, coding, testing, and refactoring to prepare the backend for integration
### Front-end
Front-end's work was primarily learning how to use Qt Creator in order to be comfortable enough with the tools at our desposal to actually make a UI with an integrated backend when the time came. The majority of their work was researching and testing the limits of Qt Creator to see what it was able to do and how it does it. This is crucial to eventually having a smooth integration. 


## Unfinished Work
If applicable, explain the work you did not finish in this sprint. For issues/user stories in the current sprint that have not been closed, (a) any progress toward completion of the issues has been clearly tracked (by checking the checkboxes of  acceptance criteria), (b) a comment has been added to the issue to explain why the issue could not be completed (e.g., "we ran out of time" or "we did not anticipate it would be so much work"), and (c) the issue is added to a subsequent sprint, so that it can be addressed later.
